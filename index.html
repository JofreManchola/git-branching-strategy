            # Branching strategy in Git
            ---
            Branching strategy in Git refers to the approach a team or individual takes to manage different lines of development within a Git repository. It involves creating, merging, and organizing branches to facilitate collaboration, parallel development, and the integration of new features or fixes into a codebase. There are several common branching strategies, each with its own benefits and use cases

              ## Trunk-Based Development
              In this strategy, development happens directly on the main branch (often called trunk), without long-lived feature branches. Developers work on small, incremental changes and commit them directly to the main branch. Continuous Integration and automated testing play a crucial role in ensuring the stability of the trunk.

              ## Feature Branching
              In this strategy, each new feature or task is developed in its own branch. Developers work independently on their features without interfering with the main codebase. Once the feature is completed, it's merged back into the main branch (often **master** or **main**).
              ---
              ## Features
              - One branch per feature
              - Short delivery cycle
              - CI/CD
              - Pull requests
              ---
              ## When to use it
              - Small applications
              - Able to split the work into small chunks that can be done independently

              ## Gitflow
              Gitflow is a branching model that defines a strict branching structure. It involves two main branches: **`master`** and **`develop`**. New features are developed in separate branches based on **`develop`**, and when completed, they are merged back into **`develop`**. Periodically, develop is merged into **`master`** to release stable versions.
              ---
              ## Features
              - The main branch is the reflection of production
              - Branches, branches, and more branches

              ## GitHub Flow
              This is a simpler branching model than Gitflow. It typically involves just one main branch (main), where all development happens. Developers create feature branches from main, work on them, and then merge them back into main via pull requests. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes are often employed to ensure the stability of the main branch.

              ## Environment branching
              Environment branching is a branching strategy used in software development to manage different environments where code is deployed, such as development, staging, and production environments. This strategy involves creating separate branches for each environment to isolate changes specific to that environment and control the deployment process.

              ## Release Branching
              In this strategy, a separate branch is created for each release version. Once a release is stabilized, bug fixes can be applied to the release branch while development continues on the main branch.

              ## Forking strategy
              The forking strategy in Git is a method for collaboration and contribution in which contributors create their own copy (fork) of a repository. This strategy is commonly used in open-source projects and facilitates a workflow where contributors can propose changes without directly altering the original repository.

              ---
              ## Ship/Show/Ask strategy

              - Ship: Merge into mainline without review.
              - Show: Open a pull request for review, but merge into mainline immediately.
              - Ask: Open a pull request for discussion before merging.

              ### How to choose a branching strategy
              - Team size
              - Team structure
              - Project complexity
              - Release cadence (frequency of deployments)
              - Deployment practices
              - Test coverage

              _It's essential to choose a strategy that fits the specific needs and workflows of the development team._
